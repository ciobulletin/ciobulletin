American technology company, Amazon, is all set to start its Digital Kendra in Gujarat. They will start their journey by availing a range of third party services like shipping and logistics support, cataloging assistance, digital marketing services, GST and taxation support.

“Last year at Smbhav, we had announced that Amazon will invest $1 billion in India to help digitize 10 million Indian MSMEs by 2025,” said Amit Agarwal, Senior VP and Country Head, Amazon India. “And today, we take one more important step towards that goal as we open our first Amazon Digital Kendra in Surat, Gujarat. This is an earnest endeavor to bring the right tools, support and services infrastructure closer to where MSMEs are based and help them benefit from e-commerce. Amazon Digital Kendra will help MSMEs grow their business with adoption of technology and play an even more important role in the revival and growth of the Indian economy.”

Amazon will blend with local partners to build up and manage the digital Kendras. This benefits local providers by providing additional revenue streams while also playing a crucial role in developing more awareness of e-commerce.

Previous year at the inaugural Smbhav Summit, Amazon had announced three important commitments - to digitally enable 10 million MSMEs, enable ecommerce exports worth $10 billion and create 1 million additional jobs in India between 2020 and 2025. The company is on track to fulfill these commitments and has already digitized 2.5 million MSMEs, enabled cumulative exports worth $3 billion and helped create nearly 1 million jobs in India till date including 300,000 direct and indirect jobs since January 2020.
