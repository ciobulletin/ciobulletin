The moderators can now also take questions in the form of text and better decide whom to call up next on the stage from the audience.

Clubhouse, the pioneer of audio-based social media apps, has launched the much-awaited direct messaging feature for all its users. The direct messaging feature has been named “Backchannel.” The primary inbox is dedicated to one-on-one chat and groups, while there is also an optional secondary inbox for message requests.

This is not the first time we have seen the text feature appearing. Last month too, it was randomly tested for some users and quickly pulled off. But now, the feature has been officially announced by the company on Twitter. The feature had been much demanded, as there was no way to communicate with Clubhouse friends privately. Most of the planning before had to be done on some other apps before starting an important audio conversation.

Clubhouse says the new feature will enhance the experience, as the users don’t have to leave the app for talking among themselves and planning before starting a room. The moderators can now also take questions in the form of text and better decide whom to call up next on the stage from the audience. Users can also use Backchannel to connect after a discussion or chat one-on-one with their Clubhouse friends.

Currently, Backchannel doesn’t let you send media apart from text, but according to a spokesperson, the feature may be introduced later with also an option to delete chats.The audio chat rooms are becoming very popular as social media giants like Facebook, Twitter, and Telegram have implemented it as an in-app feature. Even Spotify has launched their Clubhouse competitor called “Spotify Greenroom.”
