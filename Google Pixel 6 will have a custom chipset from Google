Google is developing its new SoC, which will be co-developed by Samsung. The project is named ‘Whitechapel’ and is expected to debut on Pixel. According to a report from 9to5Google, it has been spotted with Google’s “GS101” Whitechapel chipset. SundarPichai had earlier hinted about “some deeper investments in hardware” and “terrific roadmap ahead” in 2021. Whitechapel is an effort from Google to control its hardware and software much like Apple does with its ecosystem. Google will be designing the chipset in partnership with Samsung.

The devices with Whitechapel are expected to launch this year. Whitechapel has been used with the codename “Slider” in the document, and the same reference was also found in the Google Camera app. Internally, Google is referring this chip as “GS101”, with “GS” potentially being initials for “Google Silicon.” Additionally, when looked at other projects connected to “Slider,” the codename is directly connected to Samsung, including references to Samsung Exynos.

It appears that Whitechapel is being developed with Samsung Semiconductor’s system large-scale integration (SLSI) division. This could mean that Google chipsets may have some common factors with Samsung Exynos, including software components. The first phones that will be built on the “Slider” platform are “Raven” and “Oriole, “two Pixel codenames that were leaked last year. It’s possible the phones could be part of the Pixel 6 series.Google Pixel 6 will come with a center punch-hole camera. Other design features are yet to be revealed.
