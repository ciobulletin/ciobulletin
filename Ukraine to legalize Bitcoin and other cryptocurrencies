Ukraine legalizes Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, and other virtual assets.

The Verkhovna Rada, the Ukrainian Parliament, on 8 September passed the draft law to legalize and regulate cryptocurrency and other virtual assets like Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT).

Previously, cryptocurrencies were neither legal nor banned in Ukraine; they existed in a legal grey area. Ukrainian citizens could buy and trade in cryptocurrencies but were not protected if something went wrong.
