There has been significant growth in IoT technologies, and the wave of 5G-enabled devices is around the corner. Cybersecurity experts have recognized a growing and more complicated threat environment.The Air Force is keen on expanding the use of 5G, but security has been a significant concern. One strategy is the use of research and development activities to find new ways of securing these technologies.

For handling the security, Phosphorus Cybersecurity has won a Phase I Small Business Innovation Research contract from the Air Force’s AFWERX organization, which is focused on innovation and funneling new technologies and capabilities to the Air Force.Phosphorus will be working on its IoT security products into the Air Force and for use in a 5G environment. It includes ways to conduct inventory, patching, and credential management of IoT devices. Its approach is to automate security functions, the company said.

“Adapting Phosphorus’s solution to 5G in support of this effort is critical to promoting the zero-trust environment necessary to secure our defense networks,” said Chris Rouland, Phosphorus founder and CEO.Many compliance activities are in place for services and desktops, but theyshould be brought to IoT and 5G-enabled devices.“What’s needed now is a solution for the other third of the network consisting of IoT to prevent the next ‘Verkada’ while enabling the warfighter to adopt next-generation technology,” he said.Last year, Phosphorus had won another Phase I SBIR from AFWERX to work on IoT security.
